# Fast-API Face Matching üöÄ

### **Introduction: Structuring of API**

- `api_template:`  Contains all the API related Code Base.
    - `manage.py:` Only entry point for API. Contains no logic.
    - `.env:` Most important file for your api and contains global configs. Avoid using application/variable level
      configs here.
    - `application:`  It contains all your api related codes and test modules. I prefer keeping application folder at
      global.
    - `logs`: Logs is self-explanatory. FYI it will not contain any configuration information, just raw logs. Feel free
      to move according to your comfort but not inside the application folder.
    - `models:` As a part of Machine-Learning/ Deep-Learning app you might need to add model files here or if you have
      huge files on cloud add symlinks if possibles.
    - `settings:` Logger/DataBase/Model global settings files in yaml/json format.

- `application:`
    - `main:` priority folder of all your application related code.
        - `infrastructure:` Data Base and ML/DL models related backbone code
        - `routers:` API routers and they strictly do not contain any business logic
        - `services:` All processing and business logic for routers here at service layer
        - `‚öí utility:`
            - `config_loader` Load all application related config files from settings directory
            - `logger` Logging module for application
            - `manager` A manager utility for Data Related Task which can be common for different services
        - `config.py:` Main config of application, inherits all details from .env file
    - `test:` Write test cases for your application here.
    - `initializer.py:` Preload/Initialisation of Models and Module common across application. Preloading model improves
      inferencing.
